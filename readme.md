### Setup

To run this code, you will need to initialize a virtual environment in python and then install the required libraries by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run computer-vision.py and computer-vision-no-crop.py by running `python computer-vision.py filename.mp4`.

To use the AI video analyzer, see [darknet](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) and then run do-video.py to take an video and rebuild it with individually written analyzed frames.
